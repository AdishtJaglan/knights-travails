## Introduction

The BST implementation allows for constructing a binary search tree from an array, inserting and deleting nodes, performing various tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order, and level-order), checking if the tree is balanced, and rebalancing the tree if necessary.

## Features

- Build a balanced BST from an array
- Insert and delete nodes
- Find a node
- Check if the tree contains a value
- Various tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order, level-order)
- Check the height and depth of nodes
- Check if the tree is balanced
- Rebalance the tree

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6)
